# Introduction  
In today’s digital age, consumers face a growing problem—limited power to repair their own devices. The inherent power and right to repair their own devices. As technology becomes more ingrained in our lives, the right to repair has become a hot topic of debate, igniting conversations about fairness, ownership, and the environment.  This conversation has taken on new urgency with Apple’s recent decision to lift some restrictions on iPhone repairs (as of April 2024). However, it's important to understand the Right to Repair movement, what the movement means, why it matters, and how Apple is responding.

# An Overview Of Right to Repair
The right to repair is about giving consumers more control over the devices they own, including electronics like your phone and laptop, appliances like your fridge, and even cars. Specifically, it demands that manufacturers provide the tools, manuals, and parts necessary for people to repair their own products without being forced to go through the company’s expensive and often restricted service channels. The goal is to make it easier for consumers to fix their own items or work with independent repair shops rather than being reliant on the original manufacturers alone. The Right to Repair movement has seen increasing support worldwide, with countries in the European Union and certain states in the United States drafting legislation to enforce manufacturers to offer more transparent access to parts and repair information. Right to Repair ensures that by making devices more accessible for repair, we can significantly extend their lifespan, lower costs for consumers, and reduce electronic waste.

# Why the Right to Repair is Essential
The importance of the right to repair extends beyond the convenience of fixing a cracked screen or replacing a dead battery. It touches on a whole host of broader social, economic, and environmental issues. The right to repair shifts power back to consumers. When people buy a product, they deserve to fully own it (after all, we're not renting, we're BUYING) including the ability to modify, repair, or enhance it without restrictions. By limiting who can repair devices, manufacturers hold customers hostage to expensive repair services, ultimately reducing the sense of ownership consumers have over their own purchases.

Additionally, there's also a sustainability component (Someone call the Center for Sustainability Education). With e-waste being one of the fastest-growing waste streams globally, the environmental case for the right to repair is crucial. Encouraging repairs over replacements can reduce the demand for new devices, subsequently decreasing resource extraction, pollution, and the carbon footprint of production. When consumers can fix their devices, fewer items end up in landfills, helping mitigate environmental damage. When only authorized service centers are allowed to repair devices, it stifles competition. Independent repair shops are often able to offer lower prices and quicker services compared to manufacturer-operated service centers. More competition could foster innovation in repair practices and ultimately benefit the consumer market.

# Case Study: Apple's War With Right to Repair

Apple has long been a central player in the right to repair debate. Known for its closed ecosystem and strict control over repairs, Apple initially fought against giving third parties access to repair documentation and tools. For years, the company’s products were designed with proprietary screws, glued-down components, and restricted software diagnostics, making DIY repairs and independent servicing an uphill battle.

In April 2024, Apple announced it would relax its restrictions on repairing newer iPhones with used parts like screens, batteries, and cameras—a significant change from its previous practice of using software to prevent the use of non-Apple-approved components. This change came shortly after Oregon passed a law outlawing Apple’s practice of tying parts to software, known as “parts pairing,” and similar bills were being considered in other states. Under the new policy, genuine Apple parts can be used for repairs, and the iPhone will work with them automatically without requiring additional software approval from Apple. This change will apply to the iPhone 15, which was released last year, and is set to begin this fall.

Facing pressure from consumers and legislative bodies, Apple had already made some changes in 2021 with the Self Service Repair program, allowing customers access to genuine parts and repair manuals for products like iPhones and MacBooks. However, this program still had significant limitations—only certain models were covered, the tools were expensive, and the process was intimidating for many consumers. With the recent announcement, Apple took a further step in simplifying repairs, though the change still only applies to genuine Apple parts and not third-party components.

Apple’s reversal, although a positive development, is still viewed by some as insufficient. Critics, like Nathan Proctor from U.S. PIRG, argue that the restrictions on using genuine parts were always unnecessary and unfair. Independent repair shops and consumers will still face challenges, particularly when using third-party parts, as Apple’s software will continue to flag such components. Nevertheless, the recent policy shift represents a significant response to mounting consumer demands and legislative pressure, pushing Apple closer to supporting the broader goals of the right to repair movement.

# Conclusions + Citations

This has been a personal issue with me for a while, especially as a champion who loves FOSS projects and has had to deal with many aftermarket parts before. In a more analytical sense, right to repair is crucial toward putting power back into the hands of consumers, fostering competition, and addressing the environmental issues that stem from our increasingly disposable tech culture (maybe COMP390 can get a Sustainability Investigation Designation after this). As companies like Apple slowly evolve in response to consumer demands and legislative pressure, we’re beginning to see a shift toward more repairable, sustainable technology. For individuals, supporting the right to repair movement means advocating for ownership rights, making informed choices when purchasing products, and considering the impact of our consumption habits on the environment. By doing so, we can create a future where technology is not just something we use but actually own.
