# What is OSINT?
Open Source Intelligence, or OSINT, is the practice of gathering and analyzing publicly available information to generate actionable insights. This form of intelligence isn't based on secret documents or covert surveillance like those infamous three letter agencies. Instead, OSINT draws from sources such as social media, public databases, news reports, blogs, forums, and even governmental records. The amount of personally identifiable information accessible online today is astonishing and far beyond what most people realize. OSINT heavily relies on this wealth of data that is freely available to anyone with an internet connection. Although the term "open source" may initially bring software to mind, in this context, it refers to the vast array of personal and public information readily available, much of which people do not realize can be found and used by virtually anyone. 

# OSINT Techniques and Tools
OSINT investigators often employ a diverse array of techniques and tools to gather information. The most straightforward methods often involve basic web searches, such as using Google Dorks to craft specialized queries capable of uncovering hidden web pages. For those unfamiliar, Google Dorking is the practice of utilizing advanced search operators to locate sensitive information that has not been properly protected. This technique can yield surprising results, such as unsecured databases or poorly configured servers. Similarly, Shodan serves as a search engine for the "internet of things," offering insights into connected devices globally, from personal webcams to industrial control systems. 

Social media scraping tools like Twint or open databases such as the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine are also essential components of the OSINT toolkit. These tools enable investigators to recover deleted information or reconstruct a digital footprint, revealing an individual's online activity history. Other valuable resources include public record databases, breach data repositories, and DNS lookup services, all of which provide different pieces of the investigative puzzle. The power of these gathering methods cannot be understated. However, their use raises important ethical considerations. The availability of data does not necessarily justify its usage without regard for privacy. Knowing when to refrain from further investigation is often just as crucial as knowing how to gather information effectively.

# Trace Labs: OSINT in Action
Trace Labs is a great example of how OSINT can be harnessed for positive social impact. Founded in 2018, Trace Labs is a non-profit organization dedicated to using OSINT techniques to aid in the search for missing persons. By bringing together digital investigators, hackers, and individuals interested in open source investigation, Trace Labs creates a unique, collaborative environment focused on a common cause. The organizationâ€™s core activities center on Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions, where participants use their skills to gather actionable intelligence on real missing persons cases. You can check out a video below of their mission!

These Missing Persons CTFs are structured as competitive yet cooperative events where participants are rewarded for gathering useful information about missing individuals. The competition is divided into "flags," which represent pieces of evidence or leads that can assist law enforcement. Examples of these flags include new social media accounts, geolocation data, identification of known associates, or relevant photographs. All participants are, often course, expected to adhere strictly to ethical standards where only publicly available data may be used, and privacy must always be respected.

The intelligence gathered during these CTF events is verified and subsequently shared with the relevant law enforcement agencies, ensuring that the work contributes directly to ongoing investigations. Trace Labs aims to bridge the gap between law enforcement, which often lacks sufficient technical resources, and the OSINT community, which has the skills and time to devote to unsolved cases. By focusing on missing persons, Trace Labs addresses an area that is frequently overlooked due to resource constraints. Law enforcement agencies, often stretched thin, may not have the capacity to exploit all available public information, which is where Trace Labs provides crucial support. 

# Conclusion 
As someone who's used OSINT tools as part of hacking CTF including some Search Party CTFs under Trace Labs, I can confirm with bias that Trace Labs and OSINT as a whole is awesome! OSINT is a incredibly powerful field with diverse and impactful applications, and Trace Labs stands out as a compelling example of how OSINT principles can be used for the greater good. Whether you are a cybersecurity professional, an amateur investigator, or simply someone interested in using technology for a positive purpose, OSINT and platforms like Trace Labs present an opportunity to apply your skills to real-world challenges!
