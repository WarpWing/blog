# Hello World!ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ty "WarpWing" Chermsirivatana. A little bit about me, I am a 19-year-old male, based in New York, presently pursuing a major in Political Science with a minor in Computer Science as a Sophomore at Dickinson College.
As you can tell, I'm starting a blog! I'm mostly going to talk about my adventures in DevOps, Server Infrastructure, Artifical Intelligence, Cybersecurity and pretty much anything else I find interesting!
In my current capacity, I serve as the DevOps Consultant for [SkyCrypt](https://github.com/SkyCryptWebsite/SkyCrypt) and contribute as a FOSS Developer for Dickinson College's [FarmData2](https://github.com/FarmData2/FarmData2) Project.

I'm not sure what my first topic is going to be about. It's likely going to be about my time at SkyCrypt and the challenges that come with developing and scaling an application that's recieved 10M+ total users, handled billions of requests and over 350TB (factoring in site + API traffic) of outbound data over 4 years of uptime as of April 2024

Full transparency, I will say that those numbers may be inaccurate because Cloudflare's Web Analytics only retain up to 30 days (see above image). SkyCrypt often averages 6-8 TB a month, 7-8 TB from 2020-2021.

Regardless, if you find my blogs interesting or the topics exciting, feel free to stick around!

I also want to give a quick shoutout to [saicaca](https://github.com/saicaca/fuwari) who I don't know personally but has this kickass blog template that was easy to setup! You can find the repository below!

In addition, if you have something you want to talk about or just say hi, you can contact me on Discord (You can check the left hand profile for that!).
