Encryption has been the cornerstone of secure communication for decades. From the simple Caesar cipher used in ancient Rome to the complex algorithms safeguarding today's internet transactions, encryption methods have continuously evolved to outpace potential threats.

In the early days of digital communication, encryption standards like DES (Data Encryption Standard) were widely adopted. Introduced in the 1970s, DES used a 56-bit key, which was considered secure at the time. However, as computational power grew, DES became vulnerable to brute-force attacks. This led to the development of more robust standards like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and RSA, which utilize longer keys and more complex mathematical problems to ensure security.

These encryption methods rely heavily on the computational difficulty of certain mathematical operations, such as factoring large prime numbers or computing discrete logarithms. The security of RSA encryption, for example, is based on the fact that while it's easy to multiply two large primes, it's extremely difficult to factor the resulting product back into its constituent primes without significant computational effort.

**But what happens when quantum computers enter the picture?**
