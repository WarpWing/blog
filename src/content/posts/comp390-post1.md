# A Personal Preface

First, I would like to explain my motives for being here. If you're a professor at Dickinson College—especially you, Professor Braught—you may wish to skip this paragraph unless you'd like to read about my personal ramblings. I've been wanting to write on this blog for a long time but never felt entirely confident about sharing my thoughts publicly, particularly knowing that I might be surrounded by critics and individuals who are undoubtedly smarter than me. However, I've come to realize that I shouldn't let such fears constrain me. It's time to face the critiques of the internet and express my perspectives.

I recently started my sophomore year at Dickinson College, majoring in Political Science with a minor in Computer Science. I'm currently enrolled in COMP390: Free and Open Source Development Practicum, a one-credit computer science course under the guidance of Professor Grant Braught. This course is an amalgamation of COMP190 and COMP290, which collectively teach the Unix command line environment, shell scripting, system administration, debugging tools, version control, and elements of web development.

In addition, the course includes mandatory readings and discussions focusing on FOSS and HFOSS philosophy, licensing, communication tools, project and community organization, and software engineering topics related to large-scale software development. It's a comprehensive program that touches on software development and the current social, legal, and ethical issues facing computing and technology as a whole.

As part of my agreement with Professor Braught, I'm tasked with writing about a current issue that has social, legal, or ethical implications in technology on a weekly basis. Therefore, I've decided to post all of my weekly writeups on this blog. For Professor Braught, it's more engaging than a simple Markdown file or PDF. For me, it's an opportunity to enhance my writing skills and contribute my thoughts to the vast ocean of the internet.
